INSTALLATION
==========================================================================

The ENCODE-nets viewer uses CytoscapeWeb to render networks. The viewer is
self-contained. This viewer only requires that PHP to be installed. 
Installation simply involves dropping the contents of this  directory into 
a directory in your web root.

To add network files, copy them in to the /data directory and reload the
viewer. The viewer supports the following file formats:
  - sif
  - GraphML
  - XGMML
Upon refreshing the page, the updated list of files should appear.
